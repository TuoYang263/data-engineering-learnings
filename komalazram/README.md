#  Citi Bike ETL Workflow for Analytics-Ready Data

This project builds an ETL pipeline that consumes Citi Bike’s open API data and stores it in a well-structured gold-level table. The cleaned and unified data is designed to support future analytics and decision-making processes, such as:

- Identifying stations that are frequently full or empty.
- Improving resource allocation for bike availability.
- Analyzing station-level usage patterns.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

The pipeline takes a weekly snapshot and provides the updated data. It follows **Bronze → Silver → Gold** data architecture pattern:

### Bronze Layer
- Extracts and loads raw Citi Bike data from the API.
- Stores raw JSON files in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
- Performs JSON schema validation.

### Silver Layer
- Cleans and flattens raw JSON data using Python, handling timestamp formats, missing values, and data type conversions.
- Writes cleaned data to a GCS Silver bucket and loads it into a BigQuery staging table.
- Uses a MERGE operation to update the master BigQuery table with only new or changed records from the staging table.

### Gold Layer
- Aggregates and curates data for reporting and dashboarding.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Add your GCP Service Account JSON key as a secret in your GitHub repository ( GCP_SA_KEY)
3. Install dependencies using Poetry
    ```
    poetry install
    ```
4. Modify variable values in the terraform files to match your GCP project, region, and desired bucket names
5. Update environment secrets in github
6. Pass bucket names and other runtime parameters to the DAGs
7. Push the code to github and it will trigger a CI/CD workflow on master branch
